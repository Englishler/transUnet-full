## TransUNet
- On various medical image segmentation tasks, the ushaped architecture, also known as U-Net, has become the de-facto standard and achieved tremendous success. However, due to the intrinsic
locality of convolution operations, U-Net generally demonstrates limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependency. [1]
- TransUNet employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture to leverage both detailed high-resolution spatial information from CNN features and the global context encoded by Transformers. [1]

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Dataset
- UFBA_UESC_DENTAL_IMAGES[2] dataset was used for training.
- Dataset can be accessed by request[3].

## Training
- Training process can be started with following command.
    - `python main.py --mode train --model_path ./path/to/model --train_path ./path/to/trainset --test_path ./path/to/testset `
    - python main.py --mode train --model_path "F:\\DL_projects\\TransUNet-main\\model\\vit_checkpoint\\imagenet21k\\Vit-B_16.npz" --train_path "F:\\DL_projects\\dataset\\train" --test_path "F:\\DL_pro
jects\\dataset\\test"

## Inference
- After model is trained, inference can be run with following command.
    - `python main.py --mode inference --model_path ./path/to/model --image_path ./path/to/image`
